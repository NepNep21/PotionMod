# A small minecraft mod for forge 1.16.5 that adds a few things: 
 
# Potion of Hunting:
When a player has this effect, all mobs within a specific range (configurable at $WORLD/serverconfig/potionmod-server.toml) will glow (i may make it show the texture in the future if i can figure it out), brewable with "Glowing Ink", which can be crafted with 8 glowstone dust and 1 ink sac

# Potion of Luck:
This potion is normally uncraftable in vanilla, this mod adds a recipe using a nautilus shell, when with its effect your chance of getting good loot from fishing will increase

# Potion of Fishing:
When a player has this effect, items obtained from fishing will be doubled, it can be brewed with a tropical fish
